# Creating a Custom HTML Element with Web Components

This code snippet demonstrates how to create a custom HTML element using Web Components and define its behavior in JavaScript.

## Code Explanation

In this code, we define a custom HTML element named `<custom-header>` using Web Components. The custom element has a `<h1>` header with the text "hello."

### Custom Element Definition

1. We create a JavaScript class named `Header` that extends `HTMLElement`. This class represents our custom element.

2. Inside the `connectedCallback()` method, which is a lifecycle callback called when the element is connected to the DOM, we call the `render()` method to define the content of the custom element.

3. The `render()` method sets the `innerHTML` of the custom element, which consists of an `<h1>` element with the text "hello."

4. We use `customElements.define('custom-header', Header)` to register our custom element with the name `<custom-header>`. This allows us to use `<custom-header>` as an HTML element in our document.

### HTML Document

1. In the HTML document (`index.html`), we include a `<custom-header>` element within the `<body>` of the page.

2. We also include a `<script>` tag that references an external JavaScript file named `script.js`, where the `Header` class is defined.

## Web Components

Web Components provide a way to create reusable, encapsulated, and customizable HTML elements. In this example, we've created a simple custom element, but you can build more complex components with additional functionality.
